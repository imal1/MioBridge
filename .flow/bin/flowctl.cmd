@ECHO OFF
REM flowctl.cmd -- Windows batch launcher for cmd.exe / PowerShell (Claude
REM Desktop, native Codex, native Cursor). Invokes flowctl.py from this
REM directory via a probed Python interpreter. Companion to the extensionless
REM bash `flowctl` launcher (Git Bash / WSL / macOS / Linux); PATHEXT resolves
REM `flowctl` to this file in cmd/PowerShell.
REM
REM Probe = functionality, not presence: each candidate must actually run
REM `<cand> -c "import sys"` and exit 0, so the Microsoft Store `python3` App
REM Execution Alias stub (prints "Python was not found", exits 9009) is skipped
REM even though it is on PATH. Candidate order mirrors the bash launcher:
REM   %PYTHON_BIN% (command name only) -> py -3 -> python3 -> python
REM Keep this probe in sync with plugins/flow-next/scripts/lib/pick-python.sh.

REM %_prog% is intentionally UNQUOTED so a two-word `py -3` expands to two argv
REM words; this is why %PYTHON_BIN% must be a command name only. Args (%*) and
REM the dp0 path are quoted so spaced/paren'd install paths survive.
